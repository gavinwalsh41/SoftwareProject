# SoftwareProject
This is the repository for my Software Project which is the creation of a Neural Network to predict outcomes of UFC fights.

The R File and Dataset used form Kaggle are present here.

The R File contains the Pre-processing, transformation, data mining models, predict functions and hyperparameter tuning.

if needs to be ran, pre procesing and transformation of the data must be done first.
Followed by splitting the data set.
Next the models can be ran individually by following the lines of code with the description of whats occuring at each stage visible above the code. 
the results can be gathered by follwing the steps
